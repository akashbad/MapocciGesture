Formal Gesture Grammar

Overview:
	The gestures will be sent in a single frame as a '!' delimited list
	of gestures within a single string. The possible gestures are listed below.
	In addition each gesture event will include a float valued force. For ending
	events this value can be ignored and is always 0.00.
