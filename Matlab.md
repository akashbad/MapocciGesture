Matlab			{#matlab}
===============

All of the matlab files I used to process this data are included in the git repository under the Matlab folder. This folder has both raw data (from tests and other places). The data from the user test is in the userTestFixed.txt filed (the fixed refers to the removal of bad data points). In order to visualize this data open matlab and call the MapocciTestAnalysis function with the filepath of userTestFixed.txt as an argument. This will create 5 different visualizations of pieces of the data.
